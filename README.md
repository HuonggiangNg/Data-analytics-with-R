# Data-analytics-with-R
# ðŸ“Š Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning in R

This project was developed as part of the *Data Analytics with R* course, focusing on analyzing and forecasting stock prices of three major Vietnamese banks (**VCB**, **ACB**, and **BIDV**) using deep learning modelsâ€”**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**.

We performed **time series analysis**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and built forecasting models using **R** and **RStudio**. The project also includes evaluation metrics such as **MSE**, **RMSE**, **MAPE**, and **R-squared** to assess model performance.
